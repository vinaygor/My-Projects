1. Smart Water Solution:
Problem Statement:
Ever since mankind came into existence, the proper use as well as management of water has been a topic of much debate as well as caution for everyone.
One of the crucial challenges of water management as well as conservation in a city is to determine the amount of water that any particular city is going to utilize during the next day, figuring out the right amount of water that must be present in the reservoirs and overhead tanks during any particular point of time.

Solution:
-The purpose of this project is to have a smarter way of water management in order to conserve water resources and energy.
-Water utilization requirement can be met by conserving and storing the Rain Water. Rainwater harvesting is a process or technique of collecting, storing and using rainwater for domestic and various other purposes. Harvesting rainwater allows us to better utilize an energy resource and reduces water bills.  
-Proper maintenance of water outlets, their proper scheduling of repairing is must in order to reduce the water losses to leakages and breakages.
-Optimized the energy consumption requirement for pumping water. This can be achieved by ensuring a right combination of pumping configuration.
-Predictive analytics techniques can be used for getting the right amount of water at the right destination for the right duration.

Sensors:

-There is one level sensor for each storage tank.
-This checks the available amount of water in the storage tank.
-Smart switching between different storage tanks and the rainwater storage tank is done through this level sensor. 
-Flow rate sensor and Pressure change sensor are linked with water outlet to calculate flow rate and pressure change when water outlet is running.
-If sensor detects a high value in flow rate and pressure change then sends an alarm of possible leakages in the water outlet.
